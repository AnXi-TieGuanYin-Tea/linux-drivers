CS35L35 Speaker Amplifier

Required properties:

  - compatible : "cirrus,cs35l35"

  - reg : the I2C address of the device for I2C

  - VA-supply, VP-supply : power supplies for the device,
    as covered in
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt.

Optional properties:
  - cirrus,reset-gpios : gpio used to reset the amplifier

  - cirrus,stereo-config : Boolean to determine if there are 2 AMPs for a
  Stereo configuration

  - cirrus,shared-boost : Boolean to enable ClassH tracking of Advisory Signal
  if 2 Devices share Boost BST_CTL

  - cirrus,sp-drv-strength : Value for setting the Serial Port drive strength
  Table 3-10 of the datasheet lists drive-strength specifications
  0 = 1x (Default)
  1 = .5x

  - cirrus,bst-pdn-fet-on : Boolean to determine if the Boost PDN control
  powers down with a rectification FET On or Off. If VSPK is supplied
  externally then FET is off.

  - cirrus,boost-ctl : Boost Converter control word. Step Size of 0.1V
  0x00 = (Default) VP
  0x41 = 9.0V

  - cirrus,amp-gain-zc : Boolean to determine if to use Amplifier gain-change
  zero-cross

  - cirrus,audio-channel : Set Location of Audio Signal on Serial Port
  0 = Data Packet received on Left I2S Channel
  1 = Data Packet received on Right I2S Channel

  - cirrus,advisory-channel : Set Location of Advisory Signal on Serial Port
  0 = Data Packet received on Left I2S Channel
  1 = Data Packet received on Right I2S Channel

  - cirrus,classh-internal-algo : Settings for the Internal Class H Algorithm
  Can also be controlled by Mixer Settings for runtime tuning if this is not
  set

Example:

cs35l35: cs35l35@20 {
	compatible = "cirrus,cs35l35";
	reg = <0x20>;
	VA-supply = <&dummy_vreg>;
	VP-supply = <&dummy_vreg>;
	reset-gpios = <&axi_gpio 54 0>;
	boost-ctl = <0x41>;

	classh-internal-algo {
		classh-bst-ctl-override;
		classh-bst-max-limit = <0x01>;
		classh-mem-depth = <0x01>;
		classh-release-rate = <0x08>;
		classh-headroom = <0x0B>;
		classh-wk-fet-disable = <0x01>;
		classh-wk-fet-delay = <0x04>;
		classh-wk-fet-thld = <0x01>;
		classh-vpch-auto = <0x01>;
		classh-vpch-rate = <0x02>;
		classh-vpch-man = <0x05>;
	};
